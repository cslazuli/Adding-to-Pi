# Adding-to-Pi

This is a program which I worked on with a Math-Major friend. He discussed a concept where as you add increasingly small positive and negative fractions infinitely, their sum approaches Pi.

With his help, we created a program which loops as it reaches more and more several digits of Pi. I found it really interesting!

One interesting observation/behavior of this phenomenon is how the value of valueNearPi jumps slightly above Pi and slightly below Pi repeatedly as it "zeroes in" on more and more specific digits of Pi.

Fun fact: A quantum computer wouldn't be able to reach new digits of Pi any faster than a normal computer (at least using this method) because in order to calculate the next digit of Pi, you need to know the previous digits computed so far. The kinds of repeating tasks that Quantum Computers are faster at are generally ones in which they can try multiple solutions at the same time, and each successive solution doesn't depend on a preceding one.
