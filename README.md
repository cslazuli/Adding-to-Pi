# Adding-to-Pi

This is a program which I worked on with a Math-Major friend. He discussed a concept where as you add increasingly small positive and negative fractions infinitely, their sum approaches Pi.

With his help, we created a program which loops until it reaches several digits of Pi. I found it really interesting!
